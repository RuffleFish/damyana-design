I came across some interesting info about the difference between brand guidelines, UI styleguide, component library and a design system.

[When a design system is not a design system](https://medium.com/@h_locke/when-is-a-design-system-not-a-design-system-ba8c1a1e5a64) - by H Locke

To achieve consistent visuals between a landing page and browser extension UI and streamline the process of making the polished prototype, I created a styleguide.

To be precise, it's probably a mix of a styleguide and UI component library. According to the author of the article, often the correct term is not necessary in a practical team setting. He, however, calls out professionals that use "design system" interchangeably with other, quicker and easier to make, types of visual libraries.
