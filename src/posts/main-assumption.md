I was thinking about testing the main assumption first - do people want to open bookmarks, instead of exploring new content, which is inherently more rewarding?\
\
There is multiple extensions for Firefox and Chrome that open a random bookmark.

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/random-bookmark-addon/

People seem to need to:\
- open a page from a specific folder\
- use as few clicks as possible\
- open a bookmark in every new tab?\
- stumble-upon like, quick navigation

A lot of the random bookmark extensions offer few of these features or take too many clicks (selecting a folder), take up to 4-5s to load new pages.

I think that building a wireframe prototype that combines task-based browsing(workspaces), gamified opening of random saved bookmarks is a good next step.

Behavioural map

use CREATE framework to change habit. (2020, Wendel)

open browser -> type into URL bar -> leave tab open, open another link\
cue 

*?? explore more here.*



## Information architecture

**already open tab** - keep for later, close all, explore, dashboard *(available buttons on sidebar that lead there)*

**new tab** - personal space (items & rewards), explore, dashboard, ?spaces/collection

*See non-digital sketches and flows.*



## Wireframes

Started creating a prototype in Balsamiq.

**Metric** - *30% less tabs opened on average. Measured through self-report or detection? - might not work. The prototype isn't working with real data.*\
*??? self-reported browsing calmness? (1 to 10 scale)*



## Landing page in Figma

Outline is done - think about type of data collected, is it email or Discord handle? Joining a Discord server. Sections will become clearer once prototype wireframes are done. Redo to polished prototype shots or animations (just for gauging interest and testing the value proposition).

Metric - at least 25% conversion rate.
