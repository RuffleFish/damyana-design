*



Google Groups (more info needed)

Toby

* great UI/UX
* requires sorting through each tab
* crashes a lot
* heavy, takes time to load (which is not good when it opens in a new tab)



One tab

* older UI
* simple functionality
* every new set of saved tabs in a new group, by date
* it saves and closes all tabs, which is not a perfect default behaviour
* has been known to lose tabs



Duolingo



Habitica

* uses gamification
* motivates people to build habits
* initially overwhelming interface for some users
