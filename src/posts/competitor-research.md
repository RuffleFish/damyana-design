## Pocket

> "I have them. I ignore them." - person on Reddit, commenting on saved links and articles in Pocket.

* people generally use it in combination with a tool like One Tab
* integrated with Firefox 
* recommended reading list
* search through saved webpage text, saved access if original source is removed
* read saved links on ereader later
* confusing tagging or tag search

## My Mind

Independent solution. Moodboard/online space to save links, text, screenshots.

* no need to categorize - AI analyzer of articles - helps tag and organize bookmarks automatically
* no need to tag - scan text in screenshots and make it searchable. detect colors, shapes, etc. and also make searchable
* can type in notes, URLS, or drag in photos 
* privacy and security. meant to stay in the background and decrease clutter
* no free plan - everything is behind a paywall
* no structure in place
* aims to replace moodboard, bookmark manager, note-taking tools, etc

## Workona

Task-based browsing. Basically perfect at what it does.

![workona screenshot](/images/workona.png "workona screenshot")

* pinned tab of web app (instead of opening in a new tab) with accompanying extension
* task-based browsing
* can also attach files, write checklists and notes
* no need to drag or categorize each tab (high mental load in tagging - see refs.) auto-categorized within the task flow. exception is when opening the web app for the first time.
* (doesn't do gamification aspect/is paid, the free version has limited spaces, which is the only thing people don't like) - if these are even cons.
* so also solves the projects/digital fragmentation/ADHD GTD organization problem.
* low learning curve



## Google Groups

 (more info needed)

* different mental model
* requires learning



## Toby

*Image taken from https://betterprogramming.pub/my-9-must-have-chrome-browser-extensions-for-increased-developer-productivity-6188f7561a09*

* requires sorting through each tab
* great UI/UX
* crashes a lot
* heavy, takes time to load (which is not good when it opens in a new tab)



## One tab

![onetab screenshot](/images/onetab-2.png "onetab screenshot")

* older UI
* simple functionality
* every new set of saved tabs in a new group, by date
* it saves and closes all tabs, which is not a perfect default behaviour
* has been known to lose tabs

# Habitica

![habitica screenshot](/images/screenshot-2022-02-09-at-15-13-57-tasks-habitica.png "habitica screenshot")

* uses gamification
* creates task templates depending on your goals
* motivates people to build habits
* initially overwhelming interface for some users
* doesn't take into account user's mental models, customization preferences. Preset workflow.
