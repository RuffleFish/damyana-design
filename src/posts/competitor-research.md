Workona - found this late in my research

* pinned tab of web app (instead of opening in a new tab) with accompanying extension
* task-based browsing
* can also attach files, write checklists and notes
* no need to drag or categorize each tab (high mental load in tagging - see refs.) auto-categorized within the task flow. exception is when opening the web app for the first time.
* (doesn't do gamification aspect/is paid, the free version has limited spaces, which is the only thing people don't like) - if these are even cons.
* so also solves the projects/digital fragmentation/ADHD GTD organization problem.
* low learning curve

Google Groups (more info needed)

* different mental model
* requires learning

Toby

* great UI/UX
* requires sorting through each tab
* crashes a lot
* heavy, takes time to load (which is not good when it opens in a new tab)

One tab

* older UI
* simple functionality
* every new set of saved tabs in a new group, by date
* it saves and closes all tabs, which is not a perfect default behaviour
* has been known to lose tabs

Duolingo

Habitica

* uses gamification
* motivates people to build habits
* initially overwhelming interface for some users
* doesn't take into account user's mental models, customization preferences. Preset workflow.
