Throughout the middle part of researching and designing the project, I continuously ran into problems with motivation and inspiration.\
\
Here are several methods I researched and applied to help maintain consistent creative output.\

Using the Wrike tool, I followed a Kanban method for keeping track of my tasks.\

Parkinson's law

I made sure to set deadlines. As Parkinson's law states, "Any task will inflate to the amount of time set aside for it".\

How to have creative ideas by de Bono\
https://www.zsolt.blog/2020/12/Exercises%20to%20develop%20creative%20thinking.html\
I was looking for metaphor ideas for a homepage/landing page illustration that would communicate the feeling and concept behind Breeze, or TabKeeper.

Edward de Bono came up with the concept of "lateral thinking". While some of the claims in his books seem to be unsubstantiated, he offers interesting methods of "powering up" creative thinking. I came across some of these exercises while reading other materials online.

To solve a problem you're stuck on, an intriguing exercise was coming up with several random words, then randomly selecting one. After that considering ways in which the word connects to your issue and possible solutions. Example:

Challenge:  coming up with a good metaphor concept for a homepage illustration for Breeze/TabKeeper

Random word: chair

Ideas:\
- a chair, you sit on a comfortable piece of furniture in a cozy nook reading books or calmly organizing tasks for the day\
 - a chair can be used to climb onto, reach up and get on top of all the piled tasks and instead see a starry sky <- **idea I ended up using** to sketch my illustration\
- create a pillow fort between chairs to create a calm, cosy space, protected from the hectic outside world, where you can restore you energy and calm
