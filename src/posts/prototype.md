I made some sketches, and created wireframes in Balsamiq.\

Then realised I need to explore more layouts via sketching. Make changes to the IA. I also ended up making it in Figma, so I could easily test through Maze Clips. And creating a "sketch design system" to imbue it with emotionality and embed the playful concept within the design, also make the wireframes more understandable for users.
