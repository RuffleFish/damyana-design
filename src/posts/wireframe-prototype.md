I made some sketches, and created wireframes in Balsamiq.

Feedback

At each stage of prototyping, even before having all screens completed, I showed them to people around me to get some initial impressions. \
\
"This opens in your new tab. After looking at it for 15 seconds, can you explain to me what you think it does?"\
With questions like - "What actions do you think you can take on this screen?", "Is there anything here that doesn't make sense for you?"

## Iterating

Then realised I need to explore more layouts via sketching.

Make changes to the IA.

I also ended up making it in Figma, so I could easily test through Maze Clips with my exact target users remotely.

And creating a "sketch design system" to imbue it with emotionality and embed the playful concept within the design, also make the wireframes more understandable for users.

And last but not least, make this phase a bit more exciting and motivating for myself.
