The "explore" action is what I want to motivate people towards. Opening saved links from an Active (self-picked) Goal collection though gamification.

From quick feedback and testing, it seemed people didn't quite understand how that worked - within the sketch prototype, and the wireframes. Adding descriptions and action-specific text to buttons wasn't enough.

That's why I needed to clarify the

* High-level user actions - what are the users doing now?
* High-level interventions - what do I want them to do?\
  see CREATE funnel for behaviour change (2015, Wendel)
* Product features - translate the high-level interventions into specific product features.

This helped me add an onboarding sequence where people\
- pick workspaces (task-based browsing spaces. It's somewhat like opening a window for each of your activities - work tasks, cooking recipes, travel research).\
- pick a goal for a workspace (i.e. an Apprentice Chef goal - read 5 saved recipes and get a reward, get points/gems which you can exchange for objects for your Reward Corner).

Visually, it would look like this:

Two options for **adding clarity, user control and ease to the EXPLORE** action (opening a random saved link).

1) Adding a clearer, simpler EXPLORE call-to-action on the homepage. The individual links and active goals collection are already visibe there.

2) Adding a page for the EXPLORE action. With overview of the available articles and better visibility and control.

Using the Crazy Eights technique, I sketched multiple ideas.

I ended up choosing option 1.

I'm always going back to my initial requirements - as seen with competitors like Toby, it's really important that the new tab page opens and loads quickly. So that will be the first thing to check when developing.
