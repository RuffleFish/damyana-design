I explored the topic of Swiss style design. I was interested in learning more about grids, hierarchy and direct, functional communication. How the style was connected to previous movements, and currently to web and UI design in particular.

While it was used for posters, book layouts, tickets, etc., it was often applied for institutional communication. Thus direct, functional communication of ideas.

* grids
* precision
* abstract geometric shapes
* sans serif fonts (Helvetica or its predecessor Akzidenz Grotesk)
