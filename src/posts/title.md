I explored the topic of Swiss style design. I was interested in learning more about grids, hierarchy and direct, functional communication. How the style was connected to previous movements, and currently to web and UI design in particular.

While it was used for posters, book layouts, tickets, etc., it was often applied for institutional communication. Thus direct, functional communication of ideas.

According to Diogo Terror from Smashing Magazine, \
"this style of graphic design was born in the institutional context. The majority of pieces from this movement are in the form of posters, stamps, institutional typographical identity, street signs, etc. In this sense, these artists are leveraging much more than just top-down communication, they’re **creating user-friendly interfaces**.”

Other features of Swiss style design:

* grids
* precision
* abstract geometric shapes
* sans serif fonts (Helvetica or its predecessor Akzidenz Grotesk)
* photography
* flush left text, ragged right

It was interesting to see multiple examples of grid use in different materials, as well as its description as a tool within a toolbox of methods. 

“The grid system is an aid, not a guarantee. It permits a number of possible uses and each designer can look for a solution appropriate to his personal style. But one must learn how to use the grid; it is an art that requires practice.” (Müller-Brockmann)





Bauhaus - "form follows function". So removing ornamentation and any content deemed "unnecessary" to the message.
