I did some more research, and synthesized the main possible problems.



General browsing issues

* Multitasking - not really possible.
* When changing focus, people need 30mins on average to get back on track. Lost time, focus, energy.
* Pc performance.
* Too much data online (content average person is exposed to per day)
* Marketing and design departments using dark patterns, cognitive psychology knowledge to manipulate people. Variable rewards, habits.



Browsing problems, too many tabs

* people forget to read their bookmarks - hypothesis that needs further testing
* people aren't good at predicting future actions (cognitive bias), and predicting which information they'll need in the future
* organizing and sorting PI (personal information) takes up a significant amount of cognitive power
* people prefer to browse new information rather than information they've already seen/saved
* re-finding using URL auto complete or browser navigations seems to have a lower cognitive cost than opening and sorting bookmarks.
* Existing built-in browser tools seem to have a different mental model than what people who use the browser have (every individual creates their own systems for remembering items)
* Some designers/ entrepreneurs don't percieve to have a tabs problem specifically, but fragmentation of digital information and problems refinding it, too much expended time and focus. Relating to work projects - different version files, agreements.
* Collaborative link-sharing. Deciding on and organizing a shared information space is harder, because people have different mental models and preferences for keeping the info.
* People start using bookmarking and tab saving tools, then stop using them. Don't really use built-in browser features like Groups. (learning curve/mental model mismatch. they already have their own methods, like remembering words, or bookmarks with custom icon folders, or ordering the current tabs in a specific order that Groups changes)
* Dragging each new tab into a collection is annoying for people.



Some suggested solutions. Some are from a journal, others based on my user research or general cognitive psychology findings:

* highlight reel of bookmarks - link that were really hard to find, automatically detected by AI depending on time spent, number of searches.
* "out of sight, out of mind" - periodically showing old saved bookmarks on browser open, empty tab or webapp dashboard. Rewarding for opening, reading them or archiving.
* customizing content - with personalized image "tiles" for each item. (further ideas I have - visualizing link collections in different possible views - tree, with sites spent more time on being represented appearing larger; ...).
* task-based browsing - Sailboat, Workona.



Further facts:

* many people percieve a gap between their current and ideal PIM (personal information management) practices
* people with ADHD seem to have more trouble than others with keeping the amount of tabs down. Seem to experience anxiety, lack of concentration and are overwhelmed by it more than average. (from forum topics)
* people with ADHD in online communities have a lot of success organizing their day with the GTD method (writing down all tasks for the day, completing checklists). Workona and Tabler.one are very helpful.
* women are more likely to percieve a gap between their current and ideal PIM practices
* people keep tabs open because they don't want to lose information, as reminders for tasks to do
* people in a negative mood are more likely to create deep, granular folder hierarchies for PIM management. Whereas people in a positive mood will create shallower hierarchies with more items in them.
* around 15% of people in a study used their bookmarks to refind saved items, almost exclusively bookmarks visible within the top bar
* browsing doesn't offer the same sort of hierarchical filing system for bookmarks, like the desktop does for local files.
* (? double-check, be specific) development of tabs and advanced browser navigation features have decreased bookmark use??
* people would like to be taught more about organizing their digital information spaces
* people fear loss of data online (backups and syncing between devices are very important). 
* digital hoarding as a phenomenon (not diagnosis) - worth exploring more.



Hypothesis

Applying behavioural change principles can help people bridge the gap between their current and ideal PIM practices when browsing.



Main assumption

People would use a tool that motivates them to organize their browsing habits.



**Strategy & Scope**

Build towards a MVP (minimum viable product) that will be tested with at least 5 people. Will focus on a target audience of people with ADHD, working in IT, likely women. This seems to combine the target groups that are most likely to really need and benefit from a solution like this. Consequently, they would be more passionate about suggesting improvements and testing. (Yu-kai-chou, 2015)

Key action will be to **test my main assumption** - that people actually want help and motivation and are willing to spend time and build a habit opening and sorting their old bookmarks. The contained assumption is that a lot of them will contain useful information.

( cue -> action -> reward )

Later on, I could focus on a more general audience of designers, entrepreneurs, coders, people who work in IT.

Next step - synthesize research based on journals so far, competitor research, read and apply principles from Actionable Gamification, as well as Designing for Behaviour Change, sketch, wireframe, test, prototype, test, design & develop.



**Landing page**

To collect emails of people interested in testing the tool.



**Goal**

Ideally, I want to create a tool that stays out of the way, doesn't add to the information overload. Gives people a way of taking back control, focusing, shaping the way they want to use the internet and using the browser as a tool to complete their goals instead of another "window" to overwhelming, loud information noise.



**MVP features**

The features of the product are limited by the scope outline above.
