While researching, it became clear that the extension would have to be designed with careful attention to cognitive load and designing for people with various cognitive disabilities.

So I watched a talk from Remote Design Week 2021 - [Designing for cognitive disabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAa2Ebpyfs) from Tolu Adegbite (Product Designer for Shopify).

Some of the concepts were already familiar from [Mindful Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42238886-mindful-design) by Scott Riley.

Takeaways\
- cognitive disabilities - 1billion out of 8billion people have them\
- follow WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guideline) - line height, accessible language\
- descriptive page titles\
- simple language - include descriptions on the page\
- cognitive load - **amount of working memory and short-term memory someone is using in order to interact with something.** Seems like the [Recognition over recal](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/recognition-and-recall/)l heuristic rule from from [NN's 10 usability heuristic](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)s will be an important focus. \
- give users feedback and cues - so visibility of system status fro mthe 10 heuristics.\
- allow cut and paste.\
- disabled buttons - often there's a better solution (an active button that throws an error)\
- don't force the uesr to do unnecessary tasks, especially involving memorization (i.e. reading and verifying a verification code automatically)\
- avoid infinite scrolling and automatic page refresh\
- use common patterns and existing mental models\
- label icons\
- liberal use of whitespace\
- "chunking" tasks within a complex journey (fragmented experience with progressive disclosure)
