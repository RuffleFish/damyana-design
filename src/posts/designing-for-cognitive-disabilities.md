While researching, it became clear that the extension would have to be designed with careful attention to cognitive load and designing for people with various cognitive disabilities.

So I watched a talk from Remote Design Week 2021 - [Designing for cognitive disabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAa2Ebpyfs) from Tolu Adegbite (Product Designer for Shopify).

Some of the concepts were already familiar from [Mindful Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42238886-mindful-design) by Scott Riley.

On a sidenote, a piece of information that completely surprised me was that poverty affects people's cognitive capabilities and imposes a measurable cognitive load. (Nesterak, 2022) (Riley, 2019) I.e. financial pressures leave "less mental resources for the cognitive tasks, and lead to diminished performance" (Nesterak, 2022).



## Takeaways

* cognitive disabilities - 1billion out of 8billion people have them
* follow WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guideline) - line height, accessible language
* descriptive page titles
* simple language - include descriptions on the page\
* cognitive load - **amount of working memory and short-term memory someone is using in order to interact with something.** Seems like the [Recognition over recal](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/recognition-and-recall/)l heuristic rule from from [NN's 10 usability heuristic](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)s will be an important focus.
* give users feedback and cues - so visibility of system status fro mthe 10 heuristics.
* allow cut and paste.
* disabled buttons - often there's a better solution (an active button that throws an error)
* don't force the uesr to do unnecessary tasks, especially involving memorization (i.e. reading and verifying a verification code automatically)
* avoid infinite scrolling and automatic page refresh
* use common patterns and existing mental models
* label icons
* liberal use of whitespace
* "chunking" tasks within a complex journey (fragmented experience with progressive disclosure)

## Applying to the project

Several rounds of sketching, quick feedback or testing where possible.

Looking into existing patterns\
