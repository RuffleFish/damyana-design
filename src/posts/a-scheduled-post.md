This is the main question for my final project. I set out to confirm that people run into this issue, explore the possible causes and solutions.



## Research

I have been going through

*  journals about PIM (personal information management), tab use, refinding of information online.
* reviews of tab clutter solutions - i.e. browser extensions
* informal interviews with people to describe how they keep data when browsing and what problems they encounter
* forum threads about tab clutter



## Findings

**Lack of focus** is a problem for most people. A study found that on average 13 hours of an office worker's time go towards emails. Also, it takes 23 minutes on average for a person to focus back on a task after they've been distracted.

From the data, it seems **browsing clutter** and a huge amount of tabs is a specific problem that IT professionals encounter more (as "power users" of tabs). Women tend to notice the difference between their current and ideal PIM organization behaviour more. Another group that might benefit from a solution is people with ADHD, who tend to keep a lot of tabs open based on qualitative data from online communities.

**Affective states** also influence personal information management practices. People in a more negative mood tend to create deeper hierarchies with more granular subcategories, while positive emotional states engender the opposite organizational behaviour. This leads me to a hypothesis that people with mental health issues could also benefit from a solution to the issue.



## Defining the problem

Many people feel there's a gap between their current and ideal PIM practices. A lot of people keep too many tabs open. 



## Solutions

\- task-based browsing - separate spaces (with separate sets of tabs) for work, leisure, etc. Work-life balance has been even more important with more people working from home. (4)

\- reminding, describing relevance and actions-to-be-taken (1) Tabs are used for reminders, opening links in the backgronud, short-term booksmarks, going back and forth between results. Tabs seem to work as a revisitation mechanism, so a direction to explore will be **improved browser revisitation mechanisms**. Vivaldi browser with alternative tab visualization, tree branch or node visualizations of history.

\- using behaviour change principles to gamify

\- set goals (picked by the user) to make gamification meaningful (3)

\- graphical representations to improve ease of recognition of bookmarks/history items (1)

\- syncing and backup across devices (multiple studies point that loss of data is a source of anxiety)





## Future work

I'm currently reading Designing for behaviour change: applying psychology and behavioural economics by Stephen Wendel. Game Thinking: Innovate smarter & drive deep engagement with design techniques from games by Amy Jo Kim.
